              <p class="card-text">I chose to go to epicodus becuse I have been dealing with a medical disorder called auto-immune hepititis. I was diagnosed my freshmen year of collage and had to medicly withdraw. It was one of my hardest times in my life. I was bed riden for almost a year and a half. it took me about two years before I started getting better and back on my feet, but by this time I was already behind. I'm still not what I use to be to this day. However this is why I want to program so badly. It alows my to get cerrers that can be done remotely even when im not feeling well and this need is what led me to Epicodus. </p>
